libraries

* shiftpwm
* fastspi


* shift registers - how much current can they sink/source
* drivers 
* TLC5940 - common anode
* MAX....
* HL1606
* LPD6803
* size and input comparisons of the ICs
* form factor: DIP, SOP14

AVR vs. PIC

I chose PIC24F08KA101 as the controller. It needed to be powerful enough (16 bit), and requires minimum of external parts (no crystal needed to run at the max speed of 32 MHz) to save space.
