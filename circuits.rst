LED circuits
========================

Make sure you understand

* Forward Voltage and Current

A nice intro tutorial to understanding the calculations and principles of
basic LED wiring arrangements.

More advanced - learn about use of transistors and constant current circuits.

Things You Should Not Do With LEDs
----------------------------------

* Connect directly to battery
* Connect to a power source without a resistor (or a constant current driver)
* Connect to an Arduino pin without a resistor
* Connect in parallel without resistors
* Think that you don't have to limit current because you're using PWM
