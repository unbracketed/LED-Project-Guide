============================================

http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/r42iu/need_help_with_choosing_driver_for_leds/
considerations: how many run simultaneously, adjust brightness, etc.

figure out limiting factors
cost vs. design + build time vs. form factor requirements

components:

* resistor
* capacitor
* transistor
	mosfets are voltage components
	bjt are current components
