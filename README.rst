Introduction
============

This is a guide intended for hobbyists focused on building small-scale digital lighting projects, written from the perspective of a software veteran jumping into the world of microcontrollers and basic digital circuits. I’ve noticed a lot of redditors often have similar questions to myself regarding driving LED circuits so this is an attempt to gather up the best bits and pieces I’ve found. 

The circuits in most of the exercises assume the presence of an Arduino. A goal is to also often provide alternative schematics that illustrate how a circuit with the same behavior could be built using alternative simpler / cheaper components. 

Expectations
------------

Learning idioms and best practices takes time. Electronics is a vast industry and there are many ways of making things work. You’ll have to become familiar with a number of different components and their variations, tools, and electrical principles to name a few. It can be daunting to construct a circuit even when you have the schematics and parts list if you don’t have experience. You won’t know how to debug your circuits until you understand how they operate.
