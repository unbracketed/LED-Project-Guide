Materials and Tools
===================

First steps
-----------

Arduino
* A few LEDs
* A few resistors 220ohm
* Breadboard

Nailed The Basics, Ready For More
---------------------------------

* voltage regulator
* trim pots
* switch / buttons
* More LEDs
* RGB LEDs

* multimeter

Prototyping Tips
----------------

Get some header pins so you can plug directly into breadboard
Arduino's funky pin dimensions - adjust the pins 

Diagnostics
-----------

Ways to test LED works

* Plug into pin 13 
* Breadboard with resistor and 9v
* Testing common cathode and common anode RGB LEDs
