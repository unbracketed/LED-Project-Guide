Electricity and Digital Circuits
======================================================

Basics
------

* voltage, current, power
* Ohm's law
* voltage divider
* 2 transitor constant current
* source vs. sink (anode, cathode)

Components
----------
  
* resistor
* LED
* transistor
* capacitor
* shift register
* ICs

Something that might trip up novices is that some components change behavior with current; others with voltage. 

About ICs
----------

ICs often come in different package types. You'll normally want to start with DIP packaging.
Pay attention to whether the IC is a source or sink for current.


Donâ€™t work with mains power.
