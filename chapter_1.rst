Getting Started
===============

* Arduino
* A few LEDs
* A few resistors 220ohm
* Breadboard

Soon

* voltage regulator
* trim pots
* switch / buttons
* More LEDs
* RGB LEDs

* multimeter
* pliers
* cutters
* wire stripper
* wall wart

Later
 
* transistors
* 555 
* Shift registers
* driver ICs
* 

Assumes a basic working knowledge of the Arduino environment and breadboarding basics.

Chapter 4 - Planning Your Project
--------------------------------------------

http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/r42iu/need_help_with_choosing_driver_for_leds/
considerations: how many run simultaneously, adjust brightness, etc.

figure out limiting factors
cost vs. design + build time vs. form factor requirements

components:
resistor
capacitor
transistor
	mosfets are voltage components
	bjt are current components

AVR vs. PIC
http://www.instructables.com/id/Aurora-9x18-RGB-LED-art/step2/Circuit/
I chose PIC24F08KA101 as the controller. It needed to be powerful enough (16 bit), and requires minimum of external parts (no crystal needed to run at the max speed of 32 MHz) to save space.
